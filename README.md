## Project Work: Analyze different weather conditions and their impact on different types of vehicles involved in road accidents.
This project aims to figure out how weather influences road safety, especially if the weather conditions affect the types of vehicles involved in an accident, which is super important for creating better safety rules. It checks out how different weather conditions relate to the number of accidents. It looks at accident data from Berlin to see how these weather conditions impact the number of accidents.<br><br>
All project work is **present** in the `project` folder.
### Insights of the Project:
1. **Comprehensive Analysis Report: [report.ipynb](https://github.com/sahil-sharma-50/WS23-MADE-project/blob/main/project/report.ipynb)**
2. **Presentation Slides: [slides.pdf](https://github.com/sahil-sharma-50/WS23-MADE-project/blob/main/project/slides.pdf)**
3. **Presentation Video: [presentation-video.mp4](https://github.com/sahil-sharma-50/WS23-MADE-project/blob/main/project/presentation-video.mp4)**

This project aims to investigate the following aspects:
<ol>
	<li>Which road condition has the most impact on road accidents?</li>
	<li>Which type of vehicle is most likely to be involved in an accident?</li>
	<li>How do different weather conditions impact the types of vehicles involved in accidents?</li>
	<li>Is there any trend in vehicle accidents over the period of a year?</li>
</ol>

Before you begin, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your pc. We will work with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
## Installation:
1. Jupyter notebook
```bash
pip install notebook
```
2. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahil-sharma-50/WS23-MADE-project.git
```
## Development Workflow
1. Run data pipeline
```bash
python project/data_pipeline.py
```
2. Run test script
```bash
python project/test.py
```

The easiest way to do so is to set up [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).
